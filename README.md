That's a big milestone — **congratulations! 🎉**
A live, fully functional mini project with frontend + backend is a huge step forward, and documenting it in a clear README is a great next move.

Here’s a complete, well-structured `README.md` for your **C2C Converter** GitHub repo:

---

## 📄 `README.md`

```markdown
# 💱 C2C Converter

A mini web application that converts **cryptocurrency prices to local currencies** and supports **currency-to-currency** conversion — built with **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **web scraping**.

> 🚀 My very first complete mini project with both frontend and backend — and it's live!

## 🚧 How It Works

### 📊 Coin to Currency
- Scrapes latest crypto data from **[CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)**
- Gets real-time conversion rates using **[Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance)**

### 💱 Currency to Currency
- Allows conversion between fiat currencies (e.g., EUR → PKR)

### 🧠 Game
- A simple interactive number guessing game using `st.number_input()` and `st.toast()`

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/C2C.git
cd C2C
````

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run Streamlit app**

```bash
streamlit run C2C/main.py
```

---

## 📦 Requirements

Check `requirements.txt`, but the key libraries are:

* `streamlit`
* `requests`
* `beautifulsoup4`
* `Pillow`

---

## 💬 A Note from Me

This is my **first fully functional mini project**, combining:

* Clean UI using Streamlit
* Real-time data from the web
* Python logic for conversions
* Page-based structure for scalability

Deployed and working — and I’m super proud of it! 🎉

## ✅ What to Do Next

1. **Replace `https://<your-streamlit-cloud-link>`** with your actual app URL  
   (You can find it in your Streamlit Cloud dashboard.)

2. Add this file to your repo:

- Create a file named `README.md` in your root directory (same as `C2C/`)
- Paste the content above into it
- Commit and push
